BuddyPress Activity Plus Reloaded allows for embedding of oEmbed videos and media in your activities.

== Description ==

BuddyPress Activity Plus Reloaded gives your social network all the features and ease of Facebook when it comes to uploading and sharing media!

It is a fork of now unmaintained [BuddyPress Activity Plus](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/buddypress-activity-plus/)
The plugin adds 3 new buttons to your BuddyPress activity stream.  Enabling you to attach photos, videos, and even share web links with everyone on your network!

Here's the quick overview of this plugin's features:
 * Upload a photo (or multiple) directly from your computer to the activity stream
 * Embed a video from popular sites such as youtube and vimeo by copying the link
 * Embed a link to any site - the site title and description will automatically be pulled in
 * Embedding a link also allows you to choose a thumbnail image from a list of images on the site's homepage
 * Works perfectly with any theme based on the BuddyPress Default theme
